You also need to install pytorch and pyvision using pytorch's website. https://pytorch.org/

You'll also need to grab a base model to run UI Anything with. Meta provides some on their repository, but others have trained new models as well.

You also need CLIP which can be found here: https://github.com/openai/CLIP
